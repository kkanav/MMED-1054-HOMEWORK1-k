		<h2>The Chronicles of Riddick</h2>
		<h4>AKA The Story of Alec Riddick So Far</h4>
		<p>
			Alec Riddick is a 20 year old from the small town of Markdale, Ontario. As a child, he loved drawing and designing different things, to the point where his friends stopped coming over because that's all he wanted to do. In high school, he learned about the Adobe Creative Cloud programs and discovered a new passion for graphic design.
		<br>
			He attended Humber College for Advertising and Graphic Design and enjoyed the program but really liked the web design class. However, it's content was cut short as this was when the Ontario colleges went on strike. Eager to discover more about the world of web design, he interned at an agency in London called tbk Creative. There he learned about a program at Fanshawe that had taught many of their developers about web and digital design. 
		<br>
			Alec has worked as a Level 1 ski instructor and is a certified CANSail 3/4 sailing coach. He has been head coach at a sailing school in Meaford for the past two years. In his spare time, he enjoys working out and playing video games like Halo, Shadow of War, and Minecraft.
